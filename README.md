Greetings! This is a project that I am currently working on for a small business. 

The buisiness is called Shark Reef Transportation are in the logistics industry and asked me to redo their website. 

For this project, I am using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and Materialize. For the contact form, I may use PHP or an API.

This is still a work in progress as I need to go over the content with the owners for approval and discuss other pages, images, and plans.

The original website is here: http://www.sharkreeftrans.com/ so if you or anyone you know is in the logistics industry, give them a call! They're very nice.
