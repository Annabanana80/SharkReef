Greetings! This is a project that I am currently working on for a small business that asked me to redo their website. 

The company is Shark Reef Transportation and they are in the logistics industry. 

For this project, I am using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and Materialize. For the contact form, I may use PHP or an API.

This is still a work in progress as I need to go over the content with the owners for approval and discuss other pages and images.
